- Colours on some of the elements seem different from the hex values provided, I have used the closest hex values/added a couple to keep design close
- Stuck with style.className - was thinking about bringing in CX classnames but for sake of time didn't
- Tried to keep fetching simple, was thinking to bring it something like useQuery but for sake of time didn't
- Added test for key areas, didn't go fully into all edge cases
- Added loading and error states, didn't flesh them out
- Added close button, without the SVG on the modal
- Would have explored headings component more/text component to reuse need to duplicate styling
- No e2e testing, wasn't sure if a requirement
